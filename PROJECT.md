# ExpressPHP project guide

ExpressPHP is a small PHP framework and REST API starter. It receives HTTP requests, checks their input and access rules, runs the requested action, and sends a response. It uses core PHP and PDO without Composer packages.

This guide explains every maintained project file. Files created while the API runs are explained by their filename patterns under `storage/`, because their names and number change over time. All paths below start at the project root.

## The main folders

| Folder | What belongs here |
|---|---|
| `app/` | Your application's controllers, models, and access checks. These classes use the `App\` namespace. |
| `src/` | The reusable framework tools. These classes use the `ExpressPHP\` namespace. |
| `config/` | Settings you edit for this installation. |
| `routes/` | The API URLs and the actions they run. |
| `migrations/` | Instructions for creating or changing application database tables. |
| `cli/` | Commands you run from the terminal. |
| `public/` | The HTTP entry point and its Apache rules. |
| `storage/` | Private files created while the application runs. |

A **controller** handles an API request. A **model** reads or saves application data. **Middleware** checks a request before the controller runs. A **route** connects an HTTP method and URL to a controller method.

## Files at the project root

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `index.php` | The entry point when the whole project is the website's root. It passes execution to `public/index.php`. |
| `.htaccess` | Apache rules for requests entering the project root. Sends URLs to `index.php`, preserves authorization headers, disables directory browsing, and blocks direct access to source code, settings, private storage, and project documents. |
| `.gitignore` | Tells Git to ignore generated logs, limiter records, uploads, and backups. It also keeps a legacy `.env` file out of Git if one is created; the application no longer loads it. |
| `README.md` | Installation instructions, usage examples, API features, terminal commands, and production setup notes. |
| `PROJECT.md` | This file: a simple map of the project's files and how they work together. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Working rules for coding assistants and contributors, including architecture, PHP style, security, and verification. It does not run as part of the API. |
| `LICENSE` | The project's MIT license terms. It does not run as part of the API. |

If present, `.git/` contains Git's history and internal records. Git manages those files; they are separate from the application code.

## Configuration and entry points

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `config/app.php` | The PHP settings array for the application, debug output, logging, rate limits, backups, JWTs, passwords, email, uploads, databases, proxies, middleware, and CORS. Includes a commented example of a second database connection. |
| `public/index.php` | Starts the API: loads the bootstrap and settings, creates the application, registers routes, captures the request, and runs it. Returns a generic error if startup fails. |
| `public/.htaccess` | Apache rules used when `public/` is the website's root. Preserves authorization headers, blocks hidden files, and sends requests to its `index.php`. |
| `routes/api.php` | Defines every `/api/v1` endpoint and connects it to a controller method. Also assigns authentication and permission middleware to protected endpoints. |

The checks at the end of `config/app.php` catch unsafe or incomplete settings. They keep debug dumps tied to the main debug switch, reject debug mode in production, check the JWT secret and CORS origins, and require the default database fields. They check settings; they do not test a database connection.

Keep real credentials in `config/app.php` private and out of Git commits. Browser origins belong in `cors.origins`; the commented `reporting` connection becomes available only after you uncomment it and enter its settings.

## Application controllers

Controllers validate HTTP input, call a model or framework tool, and return a response. Their access rules are selected in `routes/api.php`.

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `app/Controllers/ActivityLogController.php` | Lists activity records, shows one record, and accepts a new activity description. Supports a date filter and pagination. |
| `app/Controllers/AuthController.php` | Handles registration, login, the current user, token refresh, and logout. Hashes registration passwords and invalidates older tokens when a session is refreshed or logged out. |
| `app/Controllers/DatabaseBackupController.php` | Creates a ZIP backup of the default database and sends it as a download. Records the action and removes the temporary SQL and ZIP files after sending them. |
| `app/Controllers/EmailController.php` | Sends email through a configured mailer and lists or shows delivery records. Records whether delivery succeeded or failed. |
| `app/Controllers/FileController.php` | Receives an uploaded `file`, sends it to the upload tool, and returns the stored file's details. Contains a commented example of custom upload restrictions. |
| `app/Controllers/HealthController.php` | Reports that the server is running and checks database availability with a small query. Returns an unavailable response if the database check fails. |
| `app/Controllers/PermissionController.php` | Lists, creates, edits, and deletes permissions. Also shows which roles have a permission and records changes as activities. |
| `app/Controllers/RateLimitController.php` | Lists blocked IP addresses, checks an IP's limiter status, manually blocks an IP, and clears its limiter record. Records manual changes as activities. |
| `app/Controllers/RoleController.php` | Manages roles and their permission assignments. Protects built-in roles and prevents deleting a role that users still have. |
| `app/Controllers/ServerLogController.php` | Returns request log entries for a selected date, or today when no date is supplied. Uses pagination to limit the returned entries. |
| `app/Controllers/UserController.php` | Lists, creates, edits, and deletes users; assigns roles; and shows permissions. Hashes passwords, prevents self-deletion, records changes, and invalidates old tokens when access-related user details change. |

## Application middleware

Middleware can stop a request before its controller runs. Authentication means checking who the caller is; authorization means checking what that caller may do.

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `app/Middlewares/AuthMiddleware.php` | Checks the bearer token, loads its user, and rejects invalid tokens, inactive users, or revoked sessions. Adds the verified user to the request. |
| `app/Middlewares/PermissionMiddleware.php` | Requires the signed-in user to have every permission named by the route. The `super-admin` role passes this check without individual permission grants. |
| `app/Middlewares/RoleMiddleware.php` | Allows only the role identifiers listed by the route, such as `admin`. Available through the `role` alias, although the current routes use authentication and permission checks. |

## Application models

Most models use a database table. `ServerLog.php` reads files instead.

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `app/Models/ActivityLog.php` | Saves activity descriptions with the user's details, IP address, and user agent in `activity_logs`. Reads and counts records, optionally for a particular date. |
| `app/Models/EmailLog.php` | Defines the saved delivery fields in `email_logs`, such as recipient, subject, mailer, status, and sending time. Reads and counts delivery records with an optional date filter. |
| `app/Models/Permission.php` | Works with the `permissions` table, finds a permission by its slug, and lists the roles that have it. A slug is its short identifier, such as `users.view`. |
| `app/Models/Role.php` | Loads roles, their permissions, and their assigned-user counts. Adds, removes, or replaces permission assignments; replacing the list uses a database transaction. |
| `app/Models/ServerLog.php` | Reads dated request log files and returns the newest entries first. Supplies the file contents and total count needed for pagination. |
| `app/Models/User.php` | Queries users, checks passwords, loads roles and permissions, and removes password hashes from detailed user results. Chooses the registration role and updates the session version used to revoke tokens. |

A user has one role, and a role has permissions such as `users.view`. The first registered user becomes `super-admin` when the users table is empty; later registrations receive the `user` role. Create that first account before allowing public access to a fresh installation.

The user's `session_version` is a number stored in the database and included in their token. Increasing that number causes authentication to reject older tokens.

## Terminal commands

These files are PHP programs run from the terminal. `cli/make` and `cli/rate-limit` intentionally have no `.php` extension.

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `cli/make` | Starts the file generator. Creates a controller, model, middleware class, or timestamped migration from a template. Example: `php cli/make controller Product`. |
| `cli/migrate.php` | Starts the migration runner. Shows migration status, applies pending migrations, or reverses the latest batch. Accepts an optional connection name after the command. |
| `cli/rate-limit` | Manages the same IP limiter records used by the API. Supports `status`, `block`, `clear`, and `blocked`. Example: `php cli/rate-limit status 192.0.2.10`. |

## Application database migration

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `migrations/2026_08_25_000001_init_project.php` | Creates `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`, `users`, `activity_logs`, and `email_logs`. Inserts the standard roles and permissions and grants all permissions to the administrative roles. Its `down()` method drops these tables in the required order. |

The migration creates no default user or password. The migration runner separately maintains a `migrations` table to remember which files have run. A rollback can remove tables and their data, so use it only when you intend to reverse those changes.

Keep application migrations at the project root. The reusable code that runs them belongs in `src/Database/Migrations/`.

## Framework startup and core

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `src/bootstrap.php` | Registers the class loader for `App\` and `ExpressPHP\`, records when execution started, and loads the helper functions. This lets PHP find class files without Composer. |
| `src/helpers.php` | Defines `dd()`, the shortcut for displaying debug values and stopping execution. It sends those values to `Debugger`. |
| `src/Core/Application.php` | Connects the configured framework tools and provides route registration methods. Handles requests through CORS, rate limiting, and routing; adds security headers; turns failures into responses; and writes request logs after sending the response. |
| `src/Core/Debugger.php` | Builds the developer dump page with values, request information, and runtime details. Redacts known sensitive fields and shows detailed output only when debug dumps are enabled. |
| `src/Core/MakeCommand.php` | Contains the templates and writing logic behind `cli/make`. Builds filenames and namespaces and refuses to overwrite an existing file. |

## Framework authentication

A JWT is a signed access token. The signature lets the server check that a token has not been changed; authentication middleware also checks the user's current database state.

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `src/Auth/AccessToken.php` | Builds the user-and-token response used after authentication. Includes the user's ID, username, and session version in the token and returns its type and lifetime. |
| `src/Auth/JWT.php` | Creates signed JWTs and checks incoming tokens. Verifies the signature, timestamps, issuer, and audience. |
| `src/Auth/JWTException.php` | Defines the error type for token creation and verification failures. It lets other code recognize a token-related failure. |
| `src/Auth/Password.php` | Creates bcrypt password hashes, checks passwords against hashes, and detects hashes that need updating when the configured hashing cost changes. |

## Framework database tools

PDO is PHP's database connection tool. Application models use it through these shared classes.

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `src/Database/Database.php` | Keeps connection settings, opens a named PDO connection when needed, and reuses it. Supports MySQL and SQLite connection strings; the starter's migration and backup tools use MySQL. |
| `src/Database/Model.php` | Provides shared methods for reading, creating, editing, deleting, counting, and paginating rows. Child models choose a table, an optional connection, and the fields that may be saved. |
| `src/Database/DatabaseBackup.php` | Writes MySQL table definitions and rows to an SQL file, then puts that file in a ZIP archive. Uses generated filenames in the private backup directory. |
| `src/Database/Migrations/Migration.php` | Defines the two methods every migration provides: `up()` applies a change, and `down()` reverses it. |
| `src/Database/Migrations/Migrator.php` | Finds migration files, runs pending ones in filename order, and records completed migrations in the database. Shows their status and can reverse the latest batch. |

The migration runner creates its tracking table when it starts, including when checking status. The second database example can be selected with `ExpressPHP\Database\Database::connection('reporting')` after enabling its settings.

## Framework HTTP tools

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `src/Http/Request.php` | Wraps incoming JSON, form fields, query values, headers, cookies, uploaded files, and route parameters. Provides validation helpers, trusted-proxy handling, and a place to store the authenticated user. |
| `src/Http/Response.php` | Builds and sends responses with status codes and headers. Supports success/error JSON, text, HTML, cookies, redirects, streams, and downloads. |
| `src/Http/CORS.php` | Adds browser cross-origin response headers when the requesting origin is allowed. Uses the configured methods, headers, and credential policy. |
| `src/Http/Pagination.php` | Wraps a result list with its total, limit, offset, returned count, and information about the next page. |
| `src/Http/HttpException.php` | Carries an error message and HTTP status code so the application can return the appropriate response. |

## Framework routing

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `src/Routing/Route.php` | Stores one route's method, URL pattern, action, and middleware. Matches a URL and extracts placeholders such as `{id}`. |
| `src/Routing/Router.php` | Registers routes and groups, finds the matching route, runs its middleware, and calls its controller or callback. Returns 404 when no route matches. |

## Framework rate limiting

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `src/RateLimit/RateLimiter.php` | Counts requests per IP in private JSON files. Locks files while updating them, applies pauses and blocks, and provides the manual IP management methods used by the API and CLI. |
| `src/RateLimit/RateLimitDecision.php` | Holds a limiter result: whether a request is allowed, whether the IP is blocked, remaining requests, reset time, and retry delay. The application uses it to build response headers and errors. |

## Framework validation

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `src/Validation/Validator.php` | Checks values against rules for required fields, types, sizes, dates, and database existence or uniqueness. Rejects unknown fields and returns the validated values. |
| `src/Validation/ValidationException.php` | Holds the messages produced when validation fails. The application returns these failures as HTTP 422 responses. |

## Framework logging, mail, and uploads

| File | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `src/Logging/RequestLogger.php` | Writes request details to a daily log, including response status, duration, IP address, and user information. Redacts known sensitive fields, limits logged input, and lets the API continue if logging fails. |
| `src/Mail/SMTPMailer.php` | Sends HTML or plain-text email directly through a configured SMTP server. Handles server replies, authentication, encryption, and message formatting without an external package. |
| `src/Mail/MailException.php` | Defines the error type for email configuration and delivery failures. |
| `src/Storage/FileUploader.php` | Checks uploaded files, size, extension, and detected content type before saving them under generated filenames. Supports multiple uploads and limits deletion to files inside the upload directory. |
| `src/Storage/FileUploadException.php` | Defines the error type for upload validation and storage failures. |

Exception files contain small error classes. Their job is to label a kind of failure so the calling code can catch and handle it appropriately.

## Private storage

These files contain runtime data rather than application instructions. Apache blocks direct web access to `storage/`. Database backups use a protected download endpoint. Uploaded files stay private; the current API has no download route for them.

| File or pattern | What it contains and does |
|---|---|
| `storage/backups/.gitignore` | Keeps generated backup files out of Git while keeping the backup folder's placeholder file. |
| `storage/uploads/.gitignore` | Keeps uploaded files out of Git while keeping the upload folder's placeholder file. |
| `storage/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.log` | Daily request log entries written by `RequestLogger` and read by `ServerLog`. These are different from user activity records stored in the database. |
| `storage/rate-limiter/*.json` | Per-IP request counts, violation counts, pauses, and blocks used by `RateLimiter`. |
| `storage/uploads/*` | Uploaded files stored under generated names after validation. The saved file type depends on the allowed upload policy. |
| `storage/backups/*.sql` | Temporary database exports created while preparing a download. |
| `storage/backups/*.zip` | Temporary download archives containing those SQL exports. The backup controller removes temporary files after sending them. |

## How a request moves through the files

1. Apache applies `.htaccess` and sends the request to `index.php`, which loads `public/index.php`. If the website root is `public/`, it enters `public/index.php` directly.
2. `public/index.php` loads `src/bootstrap.php`, reads `config/app.php`, creates `Application`, and registers `routes/api.php`.
3. `Request` collects the incoming method, URL, headers, and input. `Application` applies request handling, including CORS preflight and rate limiting.
4. `Router` finds the matching route and runs its middleware. A rejected request stops here.
5. The controller validates the input and carries out the action. It calls a model when it needs application data, or a framework tool for work such as email or uploads.
6. `Response` sends the result with the headers supplied by `Application`. `RequestLogger` then writes the request log.

For example, `GET /api/v1/users` goes through `AuthMiddleware`, then `PermissionMiddleware`, then `UserController`. The controller asks `User` for the data and returns it as JSON.

## Where to make changes

| Change you want | Files to start with |
|---|---|
| Change settings | `config/app.php` |
| Add or change an API URL | `routes/api.php` and its controller in `app/Controllers/` |
| Add a database query | The relevant model in `app/Models/` |
| Change access rules | The route's middleware list and, when needed, a class in `app/Middlewares/` |
| Add or change a table | A new file under `migrations/` |
| Add a terminal command | A file under `cli/` |
| Improve a reusable framework feature | The relevant class under `src/` |
| Understand installation or API usage | `README.md` |

Application-specific features belong in `app/`; shared framework behavior belongs in `src/`. Keep this file updated when you add, rename, or remove project files.
